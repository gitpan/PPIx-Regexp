  In verbose mode, have PPIx::Regexp::Dumper dump the absolute capture
    number referred to by a numbered reference.
  Have eg/preslurp pass its -verbose option to PPIx::Regexp::Dumper
  Don't use Test::More::isa_ok for the t/basic.t class heritage tests,
    since some versions of Test::More require a reference for the first
    argument of isa_ok().
