  Have PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal correctly recognize when
    charnames::vianame() is unavailable, and decouple this from the
    handling of \N{U+hhhh}.
  Add dependency on Task::Weaken, since depending on Scalar::Util
    appears not to cut it.
  Correct the assignment of the license type in Makefile.PL.

  Have PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal recognize \N{U+hhhh} (where hhhh
    represents hex digits), and provide its ordinal (hhhh). Remove
    recognition of \N. (. = any character), which Perl does not do.
  Fix $re->flush_cache() so that it actually removes $re and only
    $re from the cache.
  Add delimiters() method to PPIx::Regexp::Main and PPIx::Regexp.
    Support this in eg/prenav.
  Increase test coverage and remove dead code.
  Count tests in t/parse.t and t/unit.t

  In verbose mode, have PPIx::Regexp::Dumper dump the absolute capture
    number referred to by a numbered reference.
  Have eg/preslurp pass its -verbose option to PPIx::Regexp::Dumper
  Don't use Test::More::isa_ok for the t/basic.t class heritage tests,
    since some versions of Test::More require a reference for the first
    argument of isa_ok().
