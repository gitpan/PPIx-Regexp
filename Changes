  PPIx::Regexp::Lexer no longer fails when encountering expressions like
    m{)}. Instead, it marks the right parenthesis as an unmatched
    delimiter.

  Fixed RT 56864 - PPIx::Regexp::Lexer fails in Perl::Critic under Perl
    5.13.0. This was due to the value of a returned $+[0] getting
    transmogrified before the caller saw it. I never did isolate what
    triggered the bug.
  You can now get a tokenizer trace by setting environment value
    PPIX_REGEXP_TOKENIZER_TRACE to a non-zero numeric value. This is
    unsupported, though.

  Update copyright from 2009 to 2009-2010.
  Parse \N{...} in accordance with perl5115delta. The curlys must
    contain an alpha followed by alphanumerics, spaces, parens, colons,
    or dashes. \N{ without a matching } is a character class (if legal)
    followed by a literal '{'.
  Parse \N inside a character class as PPI::Regexp::Token::Unknown,
    since Perl 5.11.5 considers this a compile error. A \N{...} inside a
    character class is still OK.
  Add method match() to PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer. This is analogous to
    capture(), but returns the entire matched string.

  Recognize \N (without curlys), back-ported from Perl 6 into 5.11.
  Recognize unicode characters as \N{[[:alpha:]] ... rather than
    \N{[\w\s:] ... This is per the 5.11 documentation, but I think Perl
    always worked this way.
  Recognize loose matching of Unicode character classes, and allow '='
    in lieu of a single ':' in a Unicode character class (this from Perl
    5.11.3).
  PPIx::Regexp::Dumper now produces the proper output when called with
    perl_version => 1, test => 1.
  Describe the typical content of the object in the documentation for
    PPIx::Regexp::Structure::NamedCapture and
    PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::NamedCapture.

  Have PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal correctly recognize when
    charnames::vianame() is unavailable, and decouple this from the
    handling of \N{U+hhhh}.
  Add dependency on Task::Weaken, since depending on Scalar::Util
    appears not to cut it.
  Correct the assignment of the license type in Makefile.PL.

0.003	T. R. Wyant	05-Nov-2009
  Have PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal recognize \N{U+hhhh} (where hhhh
    represents hex digits), and provide its ordinal (hhhh). Remove
    recognition of \N. (. = any character), which Perl does not do.
  Fix $re->flush_cache() so that it actually removes $re and only
    $re from the cache.
  Add delimiters() method to PPIx::Regexp::Main and PPIx::Regexp.
    Support this in eg/prenav.
  Increase test coverage and remove dead code.
  Count tests in t/parse.t and t/unit.t

0.002	28-Oct-2009	T. R. Wyant
  In verbose mode, have PPIx::Regexp::Dumper dump the absolute capture
    number referred to by a numbered reference.
  Have eg/preslurp pass its -verbose option to PPIx::Regexp::Dumper
  Don't use Test::More::isa_ok for the t/basic.t class heritage tests,
    since some versions of Test::More require a reference for the first
    argument of isa_ok().
