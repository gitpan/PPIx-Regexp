PPIx-Regexp is Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

DESCRIPTION

This package parses regular expressions as they appear in Perl scripts,
generating a structure similar to the structure generated by PPI when it
parses a Perl script, and navigable in much the same way.

The PPIx::Regexp object is instantiated using either new() or
new_from_cache(). Either way, you must pass it a regular expression,
either as a string or as one of the three relevant PPI objects:
PPI::Token::StringLike::Regexp, PPI::Token::Regexp::Match, or
PPI::Token::Regexp::Substitute. In the case of new_from_cache(), only
one PPIx::Regexp object will be generated from a given PPI object;
subsequent calls with the same PPI object will return the same
PPIx::Regexp object.

See the eg directory for samples.

INSTALLATION

This module is installable by either of the two usual incantations:

  tar -xzf PPIx-Regexp-9.999.tar.gz
  cd PPIx-Regexp-9.999
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

or

  tar -xzf PPIx-Regexp-9.999.tar.gz
  cd PPIx-Regexp-9.999
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  sudo ./Build install

Of course, since it is pure Perl, in desperation you can simply drop the
files from the lib directory of the distribution into the appropriate
@INC directory.
